# Perceprton
First form of neural network was perceptron. I have implemented a basic perceptron using python


Perceptron is a single-layer neural network linear or a Machine Learning algorithm used for supervised learning of various binary classifiers. It works as an artificial neuron to perform computations by learning elements and processing them
